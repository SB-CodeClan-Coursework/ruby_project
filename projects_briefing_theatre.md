# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

:star: Remember to gather PDA evidence :star:

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. We'd ideally expect around 50 commits across the week.

## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications if you have time, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

### Theatre

A local theatre has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage bookings, and register certain customers as premium.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the theatre to create and edit customers
- The app should allow the theatre to create and edit shows
- The app should allow the theatre to book customers on specific shows
- The app should show a list of all upcoming shows
- The app should show all customers that are booked in for a particular show

#### Inspired By

#### Possible Extensions

- Shows could have a maximum capacity, and customers can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The theatre could be able to give its members premium membership. only theatre members can  book special shows (meet the cast, better time of day/week, premiers etc.)
- The theatre could mark premium members and shows as active/deactivated. Deactivated premium customers/shows will not appear when creating bookings.
- Premium customers could be stored on a page of preimium customers whereas bookings for regular cutomers would be deactivated after the show.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Thursday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points
* **Send us a YouTube link for walk-on music**. This gives you time to set up your laptop without any awkwardness. If you want your song to start at a particular second, here's how - https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

This article is an interesting read on asking for help (the author has since regretted writing it, but it still has some value)

## Attendance

The cohort will meet at the usual time every morning. Your attendance is recorded every day as normal.

## PDA Reminder:

As part of this project you are required to take screenshots of the following:

```
- A Use Case Diagram  
- A Class diagram  
- An Object diagram  
- An Activity Diagram
- A user sitemap
- Two wireframe designs
- An example of pseudocode for a function
- One of your projects where you have worked alone and attach the Github link
```

Show user input being processed according to design requirements. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user inputting something into your program
- The user input being saved or used in some way
```

Show an interaction with data persistence. Take a screenshot of:

```
- Data being inputted into your program
- Confirmation of the data being saved
```

Show the correct output of results and feedback to user. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user requesting information or an action to be performed
- The user request being processed correctly and demonstrated in the program
```

Produce an Implementations Constraints plan detailing the following factors:

```
 - Hardware and software platforms
 - Performance requirements
 - Persistent storage and transactions
 - Usability
 - Budgets
 - Time   
```

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to Canvas
